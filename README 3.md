## 🔭 Overview

This theory proposes a self-replicating multiverse, where black holes birth new universes in a recursive cosmic structure. Instead of forcing a direct reconciliation between General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Mechanics (QM), this model reframes the conflict by stepping outside it — using energy dynamics and entropy across multiple universes.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### 1. Black Hole Genesis
- Every black hole becomes a seed for a new universe.
- Our universe originated as a black hole in a parent universe.

### 2. Energy Inflow/Outflow Model
- Expansion is fueled by external energy inflow and drained by black hole outflow.
- Expansion halts when:  
  `E_in = E_out`

### 3. Modified Friedmann Equation
```
H² = (8πG/3) · (ρ + (E_in - E_out)) + Λ/3
```

### 4. Entropy Conservation
```
S_parent = S + N_bh · α · S
```
- Entropy is conserved across recursive generations.

### 5. Fractal Multiverse Tree
- Universes branch fractally like a tree, with each black hole forming a new node.
