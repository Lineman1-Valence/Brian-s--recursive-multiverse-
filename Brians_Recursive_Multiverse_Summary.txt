Brian’s Recursive Multiverse of Dynamics
========================================

Author: Brian Watson
Motto: “Born in a black hole, built by a lineman.”

Summary:
--------
This theory proposes a self-replicating multiverse structure where each black hole spawns a new universe. Unlike conventional attempts to merge general relativity (GR) and quantum mechanics (QM), this model bypasses the contradiction by reframing the cosmos as a recursive energy system with universal balance points.

Core Principles:
----------------
1. Black Hole Genesis
2. Energy Inflow/Outflow Balance
3. Modified Friedmann Equation
4. Recursive Entropy Conservation
5. Fractal Branching Universe Structure

Impact:
-------
Solves the expansion mystery, preserves quantum information, and reframes the GR/QM split.
